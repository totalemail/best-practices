# Best Practices

This repository serves as a living document for the principles we strive to use while working on this project.

Best practices have fallen on hard times as most people view them as a hindrance to effectiveness. This is unfortunate. The goal of best practices is to make a programmer (or designer, artist, athlete, etc.) *more* effective; not less. The goal of this document is to enable and equip us to work together as effectively as possible to make something amazing!

All this being said, some of these best practices may be annoying at times, but keep two things in mind:

1. Feel free to ask *why* a best practice is in place. If we don't have a good reason, we'll get rid of it!
2. If a best practice is taking up a lot of your time, automate or at least streamline the process. While it may cost you time up front, it is worth it in the long run to automate and streamline common processes.
