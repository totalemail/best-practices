# BEST PRACTICES

## GIT

### TL;DR

- You should **almost never commit to the master branch**.
- The `dev` branch will be our primary 'base' branch.
- When you're working on something, create a branch (don't work on `dev` or `master`) and make a merge request when you're ready

## SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT

### Testing

- Test the snot out of everything you possibly can.
- When you write something new: write a test for it.
- When you remove a feature: run some tests.
- When you make any change what-so-ever: run tests.

### Snippets

- [Use snippets like crazy](http://hightower.tk/2017/08/software-development-principles-one/)! They are a huge time-saver in the long run.

### Write Clean Code

- If you haven't read [Donald E. Knuth's essay on the subject](http://www.literateprogramming.com/knuthweb.pdf), you should.
- Here is a good paradigm:

  > Programs must be written for people to read, and only incidentally for machines to execute.

### Comments

- Strive to write such clean code that it needs very little commenting... that being said, some things can't be captured in code as easily as comments (good article on this balance [here](https://blog.codinghorror.com/code-tells-you-how-comments-tell-you-why/)).
- Comments really are important and you're not done writing code till you have written comments. That being said... if you're on a roll coding, keep going!!! Just write a quick todo and come back to the area in question.
