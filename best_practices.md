# BEST PRACTICES

## GIT

### TL;DR

- You should **almost never commit to the master branch**.
- The `dev` branch will be our primary 'base' branch.
- When you're working on something, create a branch (don't work on `dev` or `master`) and make a merge request when you're ready

## SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT

### Testing

- Test the snot out of everything you possibly can.
- When you write something new: write a test for it.
- When you remove a feature: run some tests.
- When you make any change what-so-ever: run tests.
